I'm currently a seminary student pursuing an M.Div. at <a href=“https://rts.edu/campuses/charlotte/”>RTS Charlotte</a>. I served for a year and a half with the <a href=“https://www.mtw.org/teams/asia-pacific/nagoya-japan”>MTW Church Planting Team</a> in Nagoya, Japan - primarily working with College and ESL outreach in PCJ church plants. When I finish seminary I plan to return to Japan! For more check out <a href=“http://thomashardison.com”>ThomasHardison.com</a>.
